This is a sledgehammery patcher to reduce the number of enemies you encounter, by adding a "Chance None" to leveled NPC lists. Default 25%.

Usage:
1. Run the patcher, preferably in its own synthesis group for speed/tidiness.
2. Go through the log and add names (no case sensitivity) to the blacklist that seem risky to touch. Err on caution to not break quests.
3. Add whole esps/esms if necessary to the synthesis group blacklist.
