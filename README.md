This patcher is intended to reduce the number of enemies you encounter, by adding a "Chance None" to leveled NPC lists. Default 25%.

Hidden due to major bug

Usage:
1. Run the patcher, temporarily in its own synthesis group for speed and tidiness.
2. Go through the log and add names (no case sensitivity) to the FewerEnemies settings blacklist that seem risky to touch. Err on caution to not break quests.
3. Alternatively, add esps/esms to the synthesis group blacklist.
4. Run patcher again.
