  "LongDescription": "An experimental/WIP patcher to reduce the number of enemies encountered by applying a 'chance none' to many leveled NPC lists. Comes with an extensive blacklist for vanilla content, creation club, Madmen/Lawless, and several others. I strongly recommend double-checking the log to avoid breaking quests. See readme.",
